Basically it's a mod made just for fun - to test Java and learn some new things :D
Yeaaahhhh. So some items might be overpriced and overpowered but! There are some new armors - even with 2 skins!
I really tried to do my best, so I can't do anything else except leaving it for you to rate :D
U can give me some advice how to improve my code, etc. or just a suggestion what to add. Even a collab! - lukasz266713@gmail.com
